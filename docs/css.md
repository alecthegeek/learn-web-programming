# Cascading style sheets (CSS)

Styles can be defined in three locations

1. Embedded in the html element with the `style` attribute. **Don't do this**.
2. In the HTML head inside the `<style>` element
3. In a separate file referenced by the .. element. This is the preferred approach so that styles are defined in one place and can be used across multiple html files

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
