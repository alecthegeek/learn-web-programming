# Cascading style sheets (CSS)

Styles can be defined in three locations

1. Embedded in the html element with the `style` attribute. **Don't do this**.
2. In the HTML head inside the `<style>` element
3. In a separate file referenced by the .. element. This is the preferred approach so that styles are defined in one place and can be used across multiple html files
